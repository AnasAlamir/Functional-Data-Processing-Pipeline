# Functional vs. Imperative Data Processing Pipeline

## 📖 Project Overview
This project fulfills the assignment requirement to implement a data processing task using two distinct programming paradigms: **Imperative** and **Pure Functional**.

The goal is to process a "dirty" dataset (`dirty_cafe_sales.csv`) containing 10,000 rows of cafe transactions. The system handles missing values, standardizes formats, performs complex transformations, and generates statistical insights.

### ❖ Task Motivation
* **Understand Core Differences:** Contrast state mutation (Imperative) vs. immutability (Functional).
* **Explore Strengths:** Compare the readability of loops vs. the elegance of pipelines.
* **Problem Solving:** Demonstrate how different paradigms approach error handling and data flow.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `imperative.py` | Implementation using **loops**, **mutable state**, and sequential logic. |
| `functional.py` | Implementation using **recursion**, **pure functions**, **higher-order functions**, and **immutability**. |
| `visualization.ipynb` |  Jupyter Notebook containing charts and graphs of the analysis results. |
| `dirty_cafe_sales.csv` | Raw input data with missing values, "ERROR" strings, and mixed formats. |
| `imperative_output.csv` | Cleaned data generated by the imperative script. |
| `functional_pure_output.csv` | Cleaned data generated by the functional script. |

## ✅ Implementation of Requirements

This project satisfies all grading criteria for both paradigms:

### 1. Handle Missing Data
* **Requirement:** Fill with defaults or remove.
* **Implementation:**
    * *Numeric (Quantity/Price):* Missing/Error values are replaced with the **Median**.
    * *Categorical (Item/Location):* Missing/Error values are replaced with the **Mode**.

### 2. Standardize Formats
* **Requirement:** Dates and numerical precision.
* **Implementation:**
    * Parses dirty strings (e.g., `"ERROR"`, `"UNKNOWN"`) into safe types (`float`, `int`).
    * Standardizes dates to `YYYY-MM-DD`.
    * Rounds monetary values to 2 decimal places.

### 3. Data Transformation
* **Requirement:** Filter, Compute, Aggregate.
* **Implementation:**
    * **Filter:** Filters specific subsets (e.g., "Coffee" sales).
    * **Compute:** Generates a new `Corrected Total` column (`Quantity * Price`) to validate the `Total Spent` column.
    * **Aggregate:** Groups data to calculate total revenue per item.

### 4. Data Analysis
* **Requirement:** Statistical summaries and trends.
* **Implementation:**
    * Calculates **Mean**, **Median**, and **Variance** for Quantity and Sales.
    * Identifies Trends (Most common Payment Method, Location, and Transaction Date).

### 5. Output Results
* **Requirement:** Save to file and console.
* **Implementation:**
    * Prints detailed statistics to the terminal.
    * Exports the fully cleaned dataset to CSV files.

## 🚀 How to Run

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10 or higher (required for `match/case` syntax).

### 1. Run the Imperative Solution
```bash
python imperative.py
```

### 2. Run the Functional Solution

```bash
python functional.py
```

**Behavior:**
* Sets `sys.setrecursionlimit(20000)` to handle deep recursion for 10k rows.
* Uses a recursive pipeline to map cleaning functions over the data.
* Uses reduce to aggregate statistics.

### 3. Run the Visualization

Open `visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

**Behavior:**
* Visualizes the statistical analysis results (Bar charts of sales, distributions, etc.).
* Provides a graphical comparison of the "Imperative vs. Functional" paradigm features used in this project.

## 📊 Sample Output

Both scripts produce consistent results, verifying that the logic is correct across paradigms.

```plaintext
--- Analysis: Quantity Sold ---
Mean:     3.01
Median:   3.00
Variance: 2.05

--- Analysis: Corrected Total (Calculated) ---
Mean:     9.65
Median:   9.00
Variance: 45.20

--- Trend: Top Selling Items ---
Most Common (Mode): Coffee
```
